# Jimmy's dotfiles

This is just a collection of my configuration files, to make it easier to
adjust. I'm addicted to wiping, reinstalling, and generally messing with my
computers and in the process, lots of little things like these get lost.

The `update` and `save` scripts are just tools for repository management.

## Usage

The stable, working files are kept in `stable/`. I symlink these files to where
they need to be to be recognized. I may develop a script to make that easier in
the future.
